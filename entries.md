**TODAY**
Kaggle - Submitted 2nd competition, "Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users"
GitHub - Set up code_journal repository
VSCode - Set up

**THOUGHTS**
Happy that I completed the first initial learning competitions on Kaggle, but I need to continue practicing to gain a better understanding of Pandas, Python, and ML

**UP NEXT**
Kaggle - For both competitions, apply recent learnings to improve prediction accuracy and rise up the leaderboards
code_journal - Iterate on format
